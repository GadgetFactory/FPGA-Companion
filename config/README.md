# XML config files

Unklike the original MiSTeryNano firmware, the FPGA companion is
configurable via XML files and thus not always has to be re-built and
updated if a core requires updates on e.g. its menu.

This directory contains XML configs for certains cores. These can
be placed in the root directory of the SD card.
